# Gift-Emergency

## Inspiration
This project is **most certainly not** inspired by our own gift-giving forgetfulness. _Anecdotally_, we've heard that certain people might, from time to time, forget to buy gifts for certain loved ones. In our eyes, any gift delivered late or, worse, not even purchased at all is a tragedy that must be prevented at all costs. On Christmas morning, no one wants a picture of a gift they'll receive in 2-3 business days.
 
**_Don't let that end-of-the-year laziness get in the way of your holiday shopping._**

## What it does
Ideally, the website matches the user with a product that's a perfect match for the potential gift-receiver. Our hack can be boiled down to a few simple steps:
- **Step One:** Panic because you haven't bought a gift for someone.
- **Step Two:** Go to our website.
- **Step Three:** Fill out our questionnaire
- **Step Four:** Buy a gift that'll ship on time in order to prevent calamity.

## How we built it
- HTML and JavaScript: used to produce the website
- Python: used to scrape Ebay
- Holiday cheer: used to generate idea

## Challenges we ran into
Our original plan was to webscrape via JavaScript in order to better-optimize the website, but certain technical challenges could only be easily overcome via the usage of Python. Additionally, we originally planned to scrape results from both Amazon and Ebay, but Amazon has certain measures (namely, a Captcha requirement) to prevent easy webscraping.

## Accomplishments and what we learned
First and foremost, this is the first-ever hackathon we've submitted to!  Being able to submit a hack at all is an accomplishment our team is deeply proud of. Jack found a gift for his uncle, refined his Python webscraping skills, and learned how to use photoshop. Miguel learned the basics of axios and webscaping for JS, which, although we didn't use in the final product, is certainly an important skill to know. 

## What's next for Gift Emergency
We hope to expand the complexity of the form, adding options for text-based inputs that could then be used to filter out or favor certain products given key-terms. As well, we hope to extend our reach to Amazon and other online vendors such as Walmart and Etsy. We also plan to add a review system that will help favor products that best meet the parameters inputted into the questionnaire.
